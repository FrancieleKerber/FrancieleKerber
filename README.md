## Hello, is there anybody in there? 

Full stack developer in constant evolution.
Restless and self-taught. Has way too many hobbies â€” and each one wildly different from the next.
Special interest in game development and mobile applications.
A mild curiosity about technology and space exploration.
Deeply inspired by art and earthly creations, though occasionally enjoys peeking at the lines of the sky.
Thereâ€™s always a cat in the code (and on the lap, too).
